Chizmiz is a simple api-based random dummy data generator for Persian language, aimed to be more practical than the conventional Lorem Ipsum things. 

It can provide you with lots of random Iranian names, email addresses, titles and texts with different length and words, etc.

## Documentation

Chizmiz is under production. A full api documentation will be published here. However, the final commands are going to be something like below:

#### Random Persian Names

For single names:

```php
~.com/a/girl-name
~.com/a/boy-name
~.com/a/last-name
~.com/a/full-name
~.com/a/full-last-name
```

For a number of names:

```php
~.com/10/girl-names
~.com/12/boy-names
~.com/25/last-names
~.com/5/full-names
~.com/100/full-last-names
```

This list will be continued for random texts, titles, email addresses, ip addresses, etc.

## Privacy Vulnerabilities

If you think some of Chizmiz futures violetes real people privacy because of accidental matchings of random strings, please open an issue and let me know what you think.
